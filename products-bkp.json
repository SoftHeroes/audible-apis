Get <i>real </i>and be <i>human</i>!</p> <p>As human beings, we are built to connect and form relationships. So, it should be no surprise that relationships must also translate into the workplace, where we spend most of our time! Companies that recognize this will retain the most productive, creative, and loyal employees, and invariably seize the competitive edge.</p> <p>The most successful leaders are those who actively form quality relationships with their employees, who honor fundamental human qualities - authenticity, openness, and basic politeness - and apply them day in and day out. Paying attention and genuinely caring about the effects people have on one another other is key to developing a winning culture where people perform at the top of their game and want to work.</p> <p>As a workplace strategist and business coach, Erica Keswin has spent over 20 years working with top business leaders and executives to build successful organizations that honor relationships. Featuring case studies from top brands such as, Lyft, Starbucks, Mogul, and SoulCycle, to name a few, <i>Bring Your Human to Work</i> distills the key practices of the most human companies into applicable advice that any business leader can use to build a “human workplace”. These building blocks include:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Understanding your company's role in the world, beyond financial profit</li> <li>Encouraging employees to be healthy in body and spirit</li> <li>Running your meetings with clear purpose</li> <li>Making space for face-to-face interaction</li> <li>Building professional development into company culture</li> <li>Inspiring your workforce to give back to the community</li> <li>Simply saying “thank you”</li> </ul> <p>A human company is real, genuine, aligned, and true to itself. A real company flaunts its humanity, instead of hiding it. It's what the most successful, sustainable companies are doing today, and there's no reason yours can't be the same.</p> <p>Keswin's leadership lessons foster fairness, devotion, and joy in the workplace - all critical elements of a successful business. By bringing your human to work, you can design a workplace that is good for people, great for business, and just might change the world.</p>", "runtime_length_min": 310, "language": "english", "authors": [{"asin": "B07C4Z1SDT", "name": "Erica Keswin"}], "categories": [{"ladder": [{"id": "21881793031", "name": "Business & Careers"}, {"id": "21881902031", "name": "Management & Leadership"}, {"id": "21882477031", "name": "Management"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881793031", "name": "Business & Careers"}, {"id": "21881904031", "name": "Personal Success"}, {"id": "21882494031", "name": "Motivation & Self-Improvement"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881793031", "name": "Business & Careers"}, {"id": "21881907031", "name": "Workplace & Organisational Behaviour"}, {"id": "21882503031", "name": "Organisational Behaviour"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881793031", "name": "Business & Careers"}, {"id": "21881907031", "name": "Workplace & Organisational Behaviour"}, {"id": "21882504031", "name": "Workplace Culture"}], "root": "Genres"}], "product_image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51wz1E2IYyL._SL500_.jpg", "web_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B09BP1TL3P", "mobile_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B09BP1TL3P"}, {"id": "B07B6235DS", "issue_date": "2004-01-22", "title": "Profitable Growth is Everyone's Business", "publisher_name": "Random House Audio", "description": "For many, growth is about \"home runs\": the big bold idea, the next new thing, the product that will revolutionize the marketplace. While obviously attractive and lucrative, home runs don't happen every day and frequently come in cycles. <p> Products like Kevlar, Teflon, and the Dell business model for selling personal computers may be once-in-a-decade phenomena. A surer and more consistent path to profitable revenue growth is through \"singles and doubles\": small day-to-day wins and adaptation to changes in the marketplace that build the foundation for substantially increasing revenues. The impact of singles and doubles can be huge. They are not only the basis for sustained revenue growth but, in fact, the foundation for home runs. Singles and doubles provide the discipline of execution, an absolute necessity for successfully bringing a breakthrough technology to market or implementing a new business model.</p> <p> Inherent in this way of thinking is the revolutionary idea that growth is everyone's business, not solely the concern of the sales force or top management. Just as everyone participates in cost reduction, so must everyone be engaged in the growth agenda of the business. Every contact of each employee with a customer is an opportunity for revenue growth. That includes everyone from the people working in a company's call center to the CEO.</p> <p> In this trailblazing book, Ram Charan provides the building blocks and tools that can put a business on the path to sustained, profitable growth. For more than twenty-five years, Ram Charan has been working day in and day out with companies around the world.

Most find this idea confusing at first because simply imagining 10X growth causes them to think they need to do 10X more work to achieve it. However, being a 10X entrepreneur is nothing like what most people think.</p> <p>10X is not the outcome; it's a counterintuitive process you can apply every time you want exponential growth in your life and business. To make 10X possible, you must focus on expanding what Dan defines as your four most important freedoms—time, money, relationship, and purpose. As your time becomes 10X more valuable, you increasingly multiply the money you earn both in terms of amount and profitable satisfaction. As money becomes a tool you can increasingly access with greater ease, you will engage with a growing number of other freedom-motivated individuals. As both your professional and personal life fills up with 10X more unique and collaborative relationships, you will realize that your most powerful purposes in all areas become 10X more lasting and positive for everyone involved. You will be impressed by what your life has become, and the meaning and impact you're having.</p> <p>10X is fundamentally about quality vs quantity, and the quality of your freedoms determines the results you achieve.</p> <p>This audio product contains a PDF with supporting material, and the PDF is available to download.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>", "runtime_length_min": 598, "language": "english", "authors": [{"asin": "B003ZFP2L4", "name": "Dan Sullivan"}, {"asin": "B00P6MYJUO", "name": "Dr. Benjamin Hardy"}], "categories": [{"ladder": [{"id": "21881793031", "name": "Business & Careers"}, {"id": "21881904031", "name": "Personal Success"}, {"id": "21882494031", "name": "Motivation & Self-Improvement"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881803031", "name": "Parenting & Relationships"}, {"id": "21881993031", "name": "Self-Help"}, {"id": "21882878031", "name": "Success"}], "root": "Genres"}], "product_image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Yt7At1eaL._SL500_.jpg", "web_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B0C2J9FW9N", "mobile_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B0C2J9FW9N"}, {"id": "B0B29PQ7BV", "issue_date": "2022-06-02", "title": "The 10X Mentor", "publisher_name": "Audible Originals", "description": "<p>In <i>The 10X Mentor</i>, available exclusively in audio via Audible, Grant Cardone—business titan, entrepreneur, real estate mogul, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, thought leader, philanthropist, and founder of the 10X Growth Conference—takes listeners underwing to teach them the fundamentals of his success, and not just modest success: We’re talking 10X success.  </p> <p>He will give you his signature takes on how to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Commit</li> <li>Set goals</li> <li>Get known</li> <li>Create a narrative about yourself</li> <li>Connect</li> <li>Improve</li> <li>Motivate</li> <li>Create multiple streams of income</li> <li>Go big or go bigger</li> <li>Create wealth</li> <li>Market yourself</li> <li>Choose great partners</li> <li>Get rid of the people, places, and things that no longer serve you</li> <li>Execute</li> <li>Follow-up</li> <li>Deal with setbacks</li> <li>Assess your business and your team</li> <li>Turn liabilities into assets</li> <li>Give back</li> </ul> <p><i>The 10X Mentor</i> offers a unique opportunity to get the 10X message directly from its source.

Basierend auf einer alten Schrift ‘Vigyan Bhairav Tantra’ gibt Osho klare Anweisungen für jede der 112 Meditationen, die leicht zu befolgen sind und er begleitet jede Meditationsübung mit einer Diskussion der Wirkungen, die die Meditation hervorrufen kann, und der metaphysischen Prinzipien, auf denen sie basiert. Die Meditationen selbst stammen aus einer tantrischen Tradition, die Osho in unsere Zeit überträgt und dem zeitgenössischen Zuhörer leicht zugänglich macht. Diese Audiobuch Serie ist ein spiritueller Reiseführer – für den Weg zu umfassendem Erwachen, mit dem Ziel der vollen Entfaltung unserer Menschlichkeit und unseres Bewusstseins. »Das Buch der Geheimnisse« wird von Kennern als Oshos große Synthese seiner spirituellen Weltsicht betrachtet. Im Eröffnungskapitel fordert Osho den Leser auf, mit jeder der Meditationstechniken, über die er sprechen wird, zu experimentieren – „spiele einfach drei Tage lang damit“, schlägt er vor und betont das Wortspiel – nicht ernst zu sein, sich nicht anzustrengen oder zu disziplinieren, sondern zu spielen und, wenn Du eine Technik findest, die bei Dir wirklich „klickt“, die Dir Spaß macht und die scheinbar etwas Neues und Frisches in Dein Leben bringt, dann kannst Du sie tiefer erforschen. Auf jede Vorstellung eine spezifischer Meditationstechnik folgt ein Kapitel mit Fragen die sich beschriebene Technik bezieht. Ein Buch fürs Leben, dessen Gehalt man nicht von heute auf morgen erfassen kann. Wer sich tiefer darauf einlässt, den wird es wohl grundlegend verwandeln.

The pharaoh's army and navy defeated them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, famine, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life a vibrant multicultural world, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires of the age and shows that it may have been their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse. Now revised and updated, <i>1177 B.C.</i> sheds light on the complex ties that gave rise to, and eventually destroyed, the flourishing civilizations of the Late Bronze Age - and set the stage for the emergence of classical Greece and, ultimately, our world today. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>", "runtime_length_min": 647, "language": "english", "authors": [{"asin": "B001HCVOR8", "name": "Eric H.

They are lazy, angry, immature, and distracted. They can make a difficult conversation impossible. But Andrew Newberg, MD, and Mark Waldman have discovered a powerful strategy called Compassionate Communication that allows two brains to work together as one. Using brainscans as well as data collected from workshops given to MBA students at Loyola Marymount University, and clinical data from both couples in therapy and organizations helping caregivers cope with patient suffering, Newberg and Waldman have seen that Compassionate Communication can reposition a difficult conversation to lead to a satisfying conclusion.  </p> <p>Whether you are negotiating with your boss or your spouse, the brain works the same way and responds to the same cues. The truth, though, is that you don't have to understand how Compassionate Communication works.

After that the other person's window of attention closes. </li> <li>Use positive speech; you will need at least three positives to overcome the effect of every negative used.</li> <li>Speak slowly; pause between words. This is critical, but really hard to do. </li> <li>Respond to the other person; do not shift the conversation. </li> <li>Remember that the brain can only hold onto about four ideas at one time.  </li> </ul> <p>Highly effective across a wide range of settings, Compassionate Communication is an excellent tool for conflict resolution but also for simply getting your point across or delivering difficult news.</p>", "runtime_length_min": 440, "language": "english", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew Newberg"}, {"asin": "B008E8KAMS", "name": "Mark Robert Waldman"}], "categories": [{"ladder": [{"id": "21881800031", "name": "Health & Wellness"}, {"id": "21881960031", "name": "Psychology & Mental Health"}, {"id": "21882758031", "name": "Psychology"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881803031", "name": "Parenting & Relationships"}, {"id": "21881993031", "name": "Self-Help"}, {"id": "21882879031", "name": "Communication & Social Skills"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881803031", "name": "Parenting & Relationships"}, {"id": "21881995031", "name": "Relationships"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881808031", "name": "Science & Engineering"}, {"id": "21882036031", "name": "Science"}, {"id": "21883089031", "name": "Biological Sciences"}], "root": "Genres"}], "product_image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41WOfkt2-rL._SL500_.jpg", "web_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B09V1YQFXQ", "mobile_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B09V1YQFXQ"}, {"id": "B079VJ7NYN", "issue_date": "2004-05-13", "title": "Today Matters", "publisher_name": "Hachette Audio", "description": "Lots of books claim they can change your life.

Yet brain scientists have uncovered details every business leader, parent, and teacher should know - like the need for physical activity to get your brain working its best. How do we learn? What exactly do sleep and stress do to our brains? Why is multi-tasking a myth? Why is it so easy to forget - and so important to repeat new knowledge? Is it true that men and women have different brains? In the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Brain Rules</i>, Dr. John Medina, a molecular biologist, shares his lifelong interest in how the brain sciences might influence the way we teach our children and the way we work. In each chapter, he describes a brain rule - what scientists know for sure about how our brains work - and then offers transformative ideas for our daily lives. Medina’s fascinating stories and infectious sense of humor breathe life into brain science. You’ll learn why Michael Jordan was no good at baseball. You’ll peer over a surgeon’s shoulder as he proves that most of us have a Jennifer Aniston neuron. You’ll meet a boy who has an amazing memory for music but can’t tie his own shoes. You will discover how: Every brain is wired differently. Exercise improves cognition. We are designed to never stop learning and exploring. Memories are volatile. Sleep is powerfully linked with the ability to learn. Vision trumps all of the other senses. Stress changes the way we learn. In the end, you’ll understand how your brain really works - and how to get the most out of it.</p>", "runtime_length_min": 480, "language": "english", "authors": [{"asin": "B002BLNBUW", "name": "John Medina"}], "categories": [{"ladder": [{"id": "21881800031", "name": "Health & Wellness"}, {"id": "21881955031", "name": "Physical Illness & Disease"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881800031", "name": "Health & Wellness"}, {"id": "21881960031", "name": "Psychology & Mental Health"}, {"id": "21882758031", "name": "Psychology"}, {"id": "21883525031", "name": "Neuroscience & Neuropsychology"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881808031", "name": "Science & Engineering"}, {"id": "21882036031", "name": "Science"}, {"id": "21883089031", "name": "Biological Sciences"}], "root": "Genres"}], "product_image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hPnb+LbxL._SL500_.jpg", "web_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B079BBJ8KT", "mobile_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B079BBJ8KT"}, {"id": "1624617476", "issue_date": "2020-09-16", "title": "Night Bloomers", "publisher_name": "Vibrance Press", "description": "<p>A clinical psychologist specializing in behavioral medicine presents a dozen practical approaches to transforming loss, pain, and suffering into positive growth and hope.

He was hugely popular throughout the 1940s and early 50s, and had the rare distinction of having plays running in three West End theatres simultaneously. Having fallen out of fashion in the Sixties, his work is now enjoying a huge revival. Included here are some of his most esteemed plays, adapted for radio and brought together in chronological order in one statement collection.<br /> <br /> We begin with the sparkling comedy <b><i>French Without Tears</i></b><i>,</i> introduced by the author himself. Next is one of his most famous plays, <b><i>The Winslow Boy</i></b>, the moving story of an innocent boy accused of theft. <b><i>The Browning Version</i></b> features a teacher overwhelmed by a schoolboy's unexpected gift, <b><i>Adventure Story</i></b> tells the dramatic tale of Alexander the Great, and <b><i>The Final Test</i></b>, adapted from Rattigan's 1951 television play, tells the comic story of a veteran cricketer's son who prefers music and poetry to cricket.</p> <p><b><i>The Deep Blue Sea</i></b> centres around the troubled relationship of Hester and Freddie, who need each other, but are worlds apart. In <b><i>Separate Tables</i></b>, a radio version of the classic stage play set in the 1950s, a small group of residents at a Bournemouth hotel discover one of them harbours a devastating secret. <b><i>Variation on a Theme</i></b> is a reworking of Alexander Dumas' classic 19th-century novel <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, <i>Ross</i> explores the enigmatic life of T.E. Lawrence and <b><i>Man and Boy</i></b> focuses on a fraudulent financier who, with his worldwide empire facing collapse, flees to the New York apartment of his estranged son.<br /> <br /> Also featured are <b><i>A Bequest to the Nation,</i></b> a dramatised account of the Battle of Trafalgar and Lord Nelson's affair with Emma Hamilton, and <i>In Praise of Love</i>, inspired by the relationship between Rattigan's friend, the actor Rex Harrison, and his wife Kay Kendall. Last up is Rattigan's final play, <b><i>Cause Célèbre</i></b><b>,</b> based on the story of Alma Rattenbury, who went on trial with her teenage lover for the murder of her husband. And in two bonus documentaries<b>, </b><b><i>Kaleidoscope</i></b><i>: </i><b><i>Terence Rattigan</i></b> and <b><i>Conversations with Terence Rattigan</i></b>, the great author discusses his life, work and influence.<br /> <br /> Among the array of stars in these enthralling dramas are <b>John Gielgud, Alan Bates, Diana Dors, Siân Phillips, Anna Massey, Amanda Root, Peter Sallis, Michael Williams, Saeed Jaffrey</b> and <b>Carleton Hobbs</b>.</p> <p><b><i>NB: This collection contains language that reflects the attitudes of the era in which the plays were written</i></b></p> <p>Production credits:</p> <p>Written by Terence Rattigan<br /> First published in 1936 <i>(French without Tears</i>), 1942 (<i>While the Sun Shines</i>),1946 (<i>The Winslow Boy</i>), 1948 (<i>The Browning Version</i>), 1949 (<i>Adventure Story</i>), 1951 (<i>The Final Test</i>), 1952 (<i>The Deep Blue Sea</i>), 1954 (<i>Separate Tables</i>), 1958 (<i>Variation on a Theme</i>), 1960 (<i>Ross</i>), 1963 (<i>Man and Boy</i>), 1970 (A <i>Bequest to the Nation</i>), 1973 (<i>In Praise of Love</i>), 1977 (<i>Cause Célèbre</i>)</p> <p><b><i>Contents List:</i></b></p> <p>· <b>French Without Tears</b><br /> Introduction by Terence Rattigan<br /> · <b>The Winslow Boy</b><br /> · <b>The Browning Version</b><br /> · <b>Adventure Story</b><br /> · <b>The Final Test</b><br /> · <b>Deep Blue Sea</b><br /> · <b>Separate Tables</b><br /> · <b>Variation on a Theme</b><br /> · <b>Ross</b><br /> · <b>Man and Boy</b><br /> · <b>A Bequest to the Nation</b><br /> · <b>In Praise of Love</b><br /> · <b>Cause Célèbre</b><br /> · <b>Kaleidoscope: Terence Rattigan</b></p> <p>Presented by Christopher Matthew with Terence Rattigan<br /> · <b>Conversations with Terence Rattigan</b></p>", "runtime_length_min": 1214, "language": "english", "authors": [{"name": "Terence Rattigan"}], "categories": [{"ladder": [{"id": "21881795031", "name": "Literature & Fiction"}, {"id": "21881918031", "name": "Classics"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881795031", "name": "Literature & Fiction"}, {"id": "21881928031", "name": "Drama & Plays"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881795031", "name": "Literature & Fiction"}, {"id": "21881929031", "name": "World Literature"}, {"id": "21882561031", "name": "European"}, {"id": "21883462031", "name": "English, Irish, Scottish & Welsh"}], "root": "Genres"}], "product_image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515O+e53lOL._SL500_.jpg", "web_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B09VCM7CT6", "mobile_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/B09VCM7CT6"}, {"id": "B07QK37G9J", "issue_date": "2019-04-10", "title": "13 Kaam Jo Samajhdar Log Nahi Karte [13 Commonwealth Games]", "publisher_name": "Audible Studios", "description": "<p>This book helps us identify 13 common habits that hold us back in life and talks about how to avoid them by using strength, adopting change, facing our fears and training our minds.</p> <p>While regular physical exercise helps to strengthen our body, there are things we can do that help us strengthen our mind.

With safe spaces and trigger warnings designed to \"protect\" kids, many adults worry that children don't have the resilience to reach their greatest potential. Amy Morin, the author who identified the characteristics that mentally strong people share, now gives adults - parents, teachers, and other mentors - the tools they need to become mental strength trainers. While other books tell parents what to do, Amy teaches parents what <i>not to do</i>, which, she says, is equally important in raising mentally strong youngsters. </p> <p>As a foster parent, psychotherapist, and expert in family and teen therapy, Amy has witnessed firsthand what works. When children have the skills they need to deal with challenges in their everyday lives, they can flourish socially, emotionally, behaviorally, and academically. With appropriate support, encouragement, and guidance from adults, kids grow stronger and become better.

Isolated from each other, the two halves of the world developed radically different suites of plants and animals. When Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas, he ended that separation at a stroke. Driven by the economic goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans. The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland, and chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures the colonists knew nothing about hitched along for the ride. Earthworms, mosquitoes, and cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions, and African grasses; bacteria, fungi, and viruses; rats of every description - all of them rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like before, changing lives and landscapes across the planet. </p> <p>Eight decades after Columbus, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country in the world. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, silver from the Americas, mined by African and Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the first time that goods and people from every corner of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served created a new world economically.</p> <p>As Charles C. Mann shows, the Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent human history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City - where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted - the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today’s fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.</p> <p>In <i>1493</i>, Charles Mann gives us an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination. </p>", "runtime_length_min": 1066, "language": "english", "authors": [{"asin": "B000AP9N94", "name": "Charles C.

But if we want to understand where the quintessential ideas of self-government and ordered liberty came from, the deliberate actions of the <i>Mayflower </i>immigrants in 1620 count much more than the near accidental arrival in Virginia 15 months earlier of a Portuguese slave ship commandeered by English pirates.</p> <p>Schools across the country have already adopted the <i>Times</i>’ radical revision of history as part of their curricula.

This book is about where the time really goes, and how we can all use it better. It's an unquestioned truth of modern life: we are starved for time. With the rise of two-income families, extreme jobs, and 24/7 connectivity, life is so frenzied we can barely find time to breathe. We tell ourselves we'd like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren't enough hours to do it all. Or else, if we don't make excuses, we make sacrifices. To get ahead at work we spend less time with our spouses. To carve out more family time, we put off getting in shape. To train for a marathon, we cut back on sleep. There has to be a better way - and Laura Vanderkam has found one. </p> <p>After interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, she realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us. Instead of letting the daily grind crowd out the important stuff, they start by making sure there's time for the important stuff. They focus on what they do best and what only they can do. When plans go wrong and they run out of time, only their lesser priorities suffer. It's not always easy, but the payoff is enormous. Vanderkam shows that it really is possible to sleep eight hours a night, exercise five days a week, take piano lessons, and write a novel without giving up quality time for work, family, and other things that really matter. The key is to start with a blank slate and to fill up your 168 hours only with things that deserve your time. Of course, you probably won't read to your children at 2:00 am, or skip a Wednesday morning meeting to go hiking, but you can cut back on how much you watch TV, do laundry, or spend time on other less fulfilling activities.

You'll learn how to best understand the culture in place today and set a new cultural path for decades to come; develop a cocreation mindset; identify influencers and blockers; ferret out skeptics and nonbelievers; measure, monitor, and report progress; and implement \"next practices\" in talent strategies to sustain the renovation.</p>", "runtime_length_min": 710, "language": "english", "authors": [{"asin": "B08PB8G8CN", "name": "Kevin Oakes"}], "categories": [{"ladder": [{"id": "21881793031", "name": "Business & Careers"}, {"id": "21881902031", "name": "Management & Leadership"}, {"id": "21882482031", "name": "Leadership"}], "root": "Genres"}, {"ladder": [{"id": "21881793031", "name": "Business & Careers"}, {"id": "21881907031", "name": "Workplace & Organisational Behaviour"}, {"id": "21882504031", "name": "Workplace Culture"}], "root": "Genres"}], "product_image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pADQb-+BS._SL500_.jpg", "web_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/1638410364", "mobile_url": "https://www.audible.in/pd/1638410364"}, {"id": "1663704619", "issue_date": "2020-07-10", "title": "The Social Network Business Plan", "publisher_name": "Gildan Media", "description": "<p>All of us know that users of the web do not read advertisements on the websites we visit, yet the online communities are emerging as the next great media rely solely on this method to produce revenue. In <i>The Social Network Business Plan</i>, social network expert, David Silver presents and explains 18 cutting-edge methods to create revenue for social network websites - none of which are advertising. He also predicts the demise of seemingly successful online communities such as MySpace and Facebook that rely on advertising as non-sustainable modalities. Silver describes and explains that in the future new products and services will be introduced, talked about, rated, reviewed and recommended - or killed - by online communities. One example of the 18 new revenue channels that online communities are adopting is the sale to vendors of anonymized conversations of the community members concerning those vendors' products or services. Another example is online communities who partner with the internet providers to receive payment when a particular online community's information is downloaded using that providers service.

Over the course of the next month, nearly 4,000 soldiers were killed on both sides, and the Indian army experienced its worst defeat ever. The conflict (war was never formally declared) ended because China announced a unilateral ceasefire on 21 November and halted its hitherto unhindered advance across NEFA and Ladakh. To add to India's lasting shame, neither Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru nor the Indian army was even aware that the 'war' had ended until they heard the announcement on the radio - despite the Indian embassy having been given the information two days earlier. </p><p>This conflict continues to be one of our least understood episodes. Many books have been written on the events of the time, usually by those who were involved in some way, anxious to provide justification for their actions. These accounts have succeeded only in muddying the picture further. What is clear is that 1962 was an unmitigated disaster. The terrain on which most of the battles were fought (or not fought) was remote and inaccessible; the troops were sorely underequipped, lacking even warm clothing; and the men and officers who tried to make a stand were repeatedly let down by their political and military superiors.

Gluten is especially a nightmare for people who suffer from Celiac disease. But going gluten-free can also be beneficial even for those with no gluten sensitivity. Those who have tried it swear they feel better and have more energy.

Easier said than done, right? Not really. All it takes is three simple 20-minute conversations.</p> <p>Alan Vengel has spent 25 years helping Fortune 500 companies empower their employees to perform at peak efficiency, generating measurable results organization-wide. Now, in <i>20 Minutes to a Top Performer</i>, Vengel shares the secret to his and his clients' success: good old-fashioned communication. Inside, he explains how to engage your employees through specific, focused conversations, of which there are exactly three:</p> <ul> <li>Coaching: focusing on performance and feedback</li> <li>Motivating: focusing on engagement and interests</li> <li>Mentoring: focusing on support and development</li> </ul> <p>Vengel dissects these types of conversations to illuminate how, why, and when to initiate each one. The conversations are not meant to be technical. They won't be uncomfortable or combative. They will simply be...conversations. And you'll be surprised at how quickly you see results. Your people will become better team players, take greater enjoyment in their work, tackle problems with verve, and, in the end, contribute valuable talent to your organization for the long term.</p> <p>Managers are facing unprecedented demands to do more with less - a trend that is clearly not going to reverse in the foreseeable future. You don't need a Harvard Business School degree or expensive new technology to empower your workforce. All you need is the drive to make change happen.</p> <p><i>20 Minutes to a Top Performer</i> is a blueprint to helping your people succeed.

Think about the immediate impact that would have on our lives. <p>Of course, everybody already knows how about gasoline has affected our driving habits. People can't wait to junk their gas-guzzling SUVs for a new Prius. But there are more, not-so-obvious changes on the horizon that Chris Steiner tracks brilliantly in this provocative work.</p> <p>Consider the following societal changes: people who own homes in far-off suburbs will soon realize that there's no longer any market for their houses (reason: nobody wants to live too far away because it's too expensive to commute to work). Telecommuting will begin to expand rapidly. Trains will become the mode of national transportation (as it used to be) as the price of flying becomes prohibitive. Families will begin to migrate southward as the price of heating northern homes in the winter is too pricey. Cheap everyday items that are made of plastic will go away because of the rising price to produce them (plastic is derived from oil). And this is just the beginning of a huge and overwhelming domino effect that our way of life will undergo in the years to come.</p> <p>Steiner, an engineer by training before turning to journalism, sees how this simple but constant rise in oil and gas prices will totally re-structure our lifestyle. But what may be surprising to readers is that all of these changes may not be negative - but actually will usher in some new and very promising aspects of our society.</p> <p>Steiner will probe how the liberation of technology and innovation, triggered by climbing gas prices, will change our lives.

A groundbreaking analysis from one of the world's foremost experts on global trends, including analysis on how COVID-19 will amplify and accelerate each of these changes.</b> </p> <p>Once upon a time, the world was neatly divided into prosperous and backward economies. Babies were plentiful, workers outnumbered retirees and people aspiring towards the middle class yearned to own homes and cars. Companies didn't need to see any further than Europe and the United States to do well. Printed money was legal tender for all debts, public and private. We grew up learning how to 'play the game', and we expected the rules to remain the same as we took our first job, started a family, saw our children grow up and went into retirement with our finances secure. That world - and those rules - are over. By 2030, a new reality will take hold and before you know it:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>There will be more grandparents than grandchildren </li> <li>The middle class in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa will outnumber the US and Europe combined </li> <li>The global economy will be driven by the non-Western consumer for the first time in modern history </li> <li>There will be more global wealth owned by women than men </li> <li>There will be more robots than workers </li> <li>There will be more computers than human brains </li> <li>There will be more currencies than countries </li> </ul> <p>All these trends, currently underway, will converge in the year 2030 and change everything you know about culture, the economy and the world. According to Mauro F. Guillen, the only way to truly understand the global transformations underway - and their impacts - is to think laterally. That is, using 'peripheral vision', or approaching problems creatively and from unorthodox points of view. Rather than focusing on a single trend - climate change or the rise of illiberal regimes, for example - Guillen encourages us to consider the dynamic interplay between a range of forces that will converge on a single tipping point - 2030 - that will be, for better or worse, the point of no return. <i>2030 </i>is both a remarkable guide to the coming changes and an exercise in the power of 'lateral thinking', thereby revolutionising the way you think about cataclysmic change and its consequences.</p> <p>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>", "runtime_length_min": 634, "language": "english", "authors": [{"name": "Mauro F.

On that same day, US Marine aviator Major Chris \"Wedge\" Mitchell is flying an F35E Lightning over the Strait of Hormuz, testing a new stealth technology as he flirts with Iranian airspace. By the end of that day, Wedge will be an Iranian prisoner, and Sarah Hunt's destroyer will lie at the bottom of the sea, sunk by the Chinese Navy. Iran and China have clearly coordinated their moves, which involve the use of powerful new forms of cyber weaponry that render US ships and planes defenseless. In a single day, America's faith in its military's strategic pre-eminence is in tatters. A new, terrifying era is at hand.</p> <p>So begins a disturbingly plausible work of speculative fiction, co-authored by an award-winning novelist and decorated Marine veteran and the former commander of NATO, a legendary admiral who has spent much of his career strategically outmaneuvering America's most tenacious adversaries. Written with a powerful blend of geopolitical sophistication and human empathy, <i>2034</i> takes us inside the minds of a global cast of characters - Americans, Chinese, Iranians, Russians, Indians - as a series of arrogant miscalculations on all sides leads the world into an intensifying international storm.

Men Al har forberedt sig godt og overtaler Jake til at tage turen tilbage til 1958, bo der i fem år og gøre et forsøg på at forhindre mordet på Kennedy. <br />Men Jake er ikke på forlystelsestur, han er en mand med en mission; det er egentlig meningen, at han skal koncentrere sig om den problematiske enspænder Lee Harvey Oswalds færden, det er meningen han skal forhindre et mord. Til gengæld er det ikke meningen, at han skal forelske sig i den smukke bibliotekar Sadie Dunhill.
